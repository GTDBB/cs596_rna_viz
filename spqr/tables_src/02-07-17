This is 01-28-17
Jacobian is not considered in the interactions - wc, nst and bst
epsilon table for bonded stacking is corrected as well, accordingly
base phosphate does not contain C-H hydrogen bonds - better to run with 8.7

This is 05-31-16
It only contains the table of the angles plus a very small correction in the base-pairing of CUpSW, both in the table and the epsilons
to be run with 8.4

It was 04-18-16

To be run from 8.0 
It was 03-31-16, but now the backbone interactions have epsilons determined in a more systematic way.

To be run with 8.0
Now base-pairing interactions have been recalculated. They are specific for both faces involved.

This was 02-11-16
To be run with 7.6
Now the bonded stacking interactions depend on faces 3' and 5'
No dihedral interaction for this kind of stacking.


It was 02-07-16
to be run with 7.5.
Backbone interactions include now puckers, at least for the glycosidic conformations 
anti and high-anti. For syn, in the case of pyrimidines, they have been patched with something else.
Angles depend only on glycosidic conformations, as before.





It was 01-28-16:
 with the real EV interactions
Now non-bonded stacking and base-phosphate have been updated according to the non-redundant pdb list.
NB st is taken as a combination of 3' and 5' faces.
The value of HBOND is 24 for BPH, but it should be changed.
The faces of a base for BPH have been redefined.
The rest is taken from 01-21-16

01-21-16
BASE PAIR INTERACTIONS have been updated, taken from the whole non-redundant pdb list of FR3D.
The value of an HBOND is now 24.
The rest is taken from 11-27-15

11-27-15:
base phosphate interactions have a heaviside-cutoff interaction as well
st epsilon is stronger
Kbb is lower
